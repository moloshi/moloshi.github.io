Hi, I'm Josh (moloshy) a hacker from Scotland. I graduated from Abertay University's Ethical Hacking course back in July 2019 and have been working as a penetration tester ever since.

My passion for technology and security started back when I was about 10 years old, when I was visiting my uncles house, enjoying a game of Minecraft with my cousins when all of a sudden, the mouse starting moving on it's own. My uncle had RDP'd into the computer to check what we were up to and I thought that was so cool. I started looking up how to hack and found myself creating dumb batch scripts and watching a 'hidden' [StarWars movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM71W8jG28s) in Windows command prompt. I continued tinkering and skidding throughout high school, eventually finding myself enrolled in the Ethical Hacking course at Abertay University, where I learned the foundations of computing and computer security, and how to *really* hack.



When I'm not hacking I enjoy working out, snowboarding and listening to music. I'm also interested in all things tech, cars and action sports.
